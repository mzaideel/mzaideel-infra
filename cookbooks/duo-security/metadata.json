  "long_description": "duo-security Cookbook\n=====================\nThis cookbook is used to install and configure duosecurity's login_duo application which enables two factor authentication on your servers.\n\nYou can find the manual installation/configuration steps here:\n https://www.duosecurity.com/docs/duounix\n\nCaveats\n-------\n- This cookbook has been tested on Debian 6.0.4 and 7.0, several Ubuntu platforms, as well as CentOS and RHEL.\n\nNote: This cookbook does not currently work on Ubuntu 9.04.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n-This cookbook requires the openssh cookbook for the ssh configuration potion.\n-This cookbook requires the build-essential cookbook. Certain OS's can require package dependencies and may vary depending on which version of the OS you are running.\n-This cookbook installs the following libraries: libssl-dev and libpam-dev.\ne.g.\n\n#### packages\n- `libssl-dev` - Duo Security requires that this package be installed.\n- `libpam-dev` - Duo Security requires that this package be installed.\n\nAttributes\n----------\nThis cookbook uses several default attributes for the installation/configuration of duo security's duo_unix app.\nYou can override these default attributes through direct node attributes if you would like.\nIt may be beneficial to use your own node attributes for different environments -- for example: a group of database servers with their own roles.\n\nI recommend that you use a different 'integration' for each environment that you use in your infrastructure.\n\nMore on integrations here: https://www.duosecurity.com/docs/getting_started\n\ne.g.\n#### duo-security/attributes/default.rb\ndefault['duosecurity']['ikey']\ndefault['duosecurity']['skey']\ndefault['duosecurity']['host']\ndefault['openssh']['server']['force_command']\n\nUsage\n-----\n#### duo-security::default\nThere is only one cookbook at this time. This automates everything for you.\n\ne.g.\nJust include `duo-security` in your node's `run_list`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":\"my_node\",\n  \"run_list\": [\n    \"recipe[duo-security]\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nContributing\n------------\n\ne.g.\n1. Fork the repository on Github\n2. Create a named feature branch (like `add_component_x`)\n3. Write you change\n4. Write tests for your change (if applicable)\n5. Run the tests, ensuring they all pass\n6.
