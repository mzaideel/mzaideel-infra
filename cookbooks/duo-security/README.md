duo-security Cookbook
=====================
This cookbook is used to install and configure duosecurity's login_duo application which enables two factor authentication on your servers.

You can find the manual installation/configuration steps here:
 https://www.duosecurity.com/docs/duounix

Caveats
-------
- This cookbook has been tested on Debian 6.0.4 and 7.0, several Ubuntu platforms, as well as CentOS and RHEL.

Note: This cookbook does not currently work on Ubuntu 9.04.

Requirements
------------
-This cookbook requires the openssh cookbook for the ssh configuration potion.
-This cookbook requires the build-essential cookbook. Certain OS's can require package dependencies and may vary depending on which version of the OS you are running.
-This cookbook installs the following libraries: libssl-dev and libpam-dev.
e.g.

#### packages
- `libssl-dev` - Duo Security requires that this package be installed.
- `libpam-dev` - Duo Security requires that this package be installed.

Attributes
----------
This cookbook uses several default attributes for the installation/configuration of duo security's duo_unix app.
You can override these default attributes through direct node attributes if you would like.
It may be beneficial to use your own node attributes for different environments -- for example: a group of database servers with their own roles.

I recommend that you use a different 'integration' for each environment that you use in your infrastructure.

More on integrations here: https://www.duosecurity.com/docs/getting_started

e.g.
#### duo-security/attributes/default.rb
default['duosecurity']['ikey']
default['duosecurity']['skey']
default['duosecurity']['host']
default['openssh']['server']['force_command']

Usage
-----
#### duo-security::default
There is only one cookbook at this time. This automates everything for you.

e.g.
Just include `duo-security` in your node's `run_list`:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[duo-security]"
  ]
}
```
